# GITGUD
 a basic plugin to provide a unit for gruvbar as well as a few keybinds useful for basic git-related tasks
 
+ First step is to provide relevant info about an open file or current directory if it contgains a .git/ folder or if the open file resides within a repo-folder.

+ next step is to provide keybinds for small scripts to do basic things like commits, pushes etc.

Of everything I've made for tmux, this is the most bespoke plugin to my persoanl use, providing shortcuts especially for the work on other plugins.

tldr; don't use this. (yet... at least)
